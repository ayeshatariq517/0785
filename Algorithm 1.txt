Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

Ask the user to enter Num and Div
Divide Num by Div
Compare remainder with 0
if equal to 0 it is a divisor
else it is not a divisor
Divide Num by 2
If remainder equqal to 0 then it is even 
else it is odd
