Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators

Ask the user to enter Num1,Num2 and Operator
if Operator is +
then set Result to Num1 + Num2
else if Operator is -
then set Result to Num1 - Num2
else if Operator is *
then set Result to Num1 * Num2
else if Operator is /
then set Result to Num1 / Num2
else if Operator is %
then set Result to (Num1/100 * Num2)
display Result
